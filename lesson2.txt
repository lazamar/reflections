What happens when you initialise a repository and why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository Git creates all the files/
it will need to keep track of the files within that repository.
It does not create a commit at that moment.
You need to initialise a repository so that you can start
controlling versions of your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory/
and what value does it offer?

The staging area is a space where files to be committed stay.
Not every file in the working directory will be part of a committ, whilst/
in the staging area, every file will be part of the commit.
It adds the value of not needing to create a new commit every time/
a new file needs to be added. This way we can keep the idea of having/
one commit per logical change

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can create changes on many files and then only add to the staging area those that,
I want to make part of each commit. If I change multiple files, but a logical change
comprises only a section of those files, I can select these and add to the staging area
leaving the ones that do not make part of the commit only in the working directory
and thus outside the commit.
